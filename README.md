# Universal Counter App

## This is a small and interactive web app that acts as a universal counter — you can use it to count anything: people, items, goals, or any activity you want to track

## The interface is clean and minimal, featuring two main buttons: one to increment the count and another to save it. Each time you press "save," the current count gets added to a list of previous entries,
and the counter resets to zero, making it easy to keep track of multiple counts during a session.

##The project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it's fully responsive across different screen sizes. It was created as part of a mini project from Scrimba’s web development course to strengthen my skills in DOM manipulation,
event handling, and working with user input

##It's deployed using Netlify, and you can try it out live using the link below.
